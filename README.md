# ComplexFace

## Notable Features of ComplexFace

- **Large Amount of Data:** ComplexFace contains a total of 74,412 face images from 70 individuals, captured in both thermal (55,890 images) and visible light (18,522 images).
- **Multiple Devices:** ComplexFace uses four different devices for collection, including one visible light device and three thermal infrared devices. Data was deliberately collected from three different thermal infrared devices, each from different manufacturers or models, to bring various device parameters. This diversity of devices makes our database more representative of real-world unconstrained conditions and more challenging.
- **Rich Scenarios:** ComplexFace includes nine angles but does not fix each person's angle or expression, making the dataset more challenging due to its unconstrained nature.
- **Disguises:** ComplexFace includes three types of disguises: masks, glasses, and sunglasses, which are commonly used accessories in daily life.
- **Pre- and Post-Sport Scenarios:** ComplexFace includes pre- and post-sport scenarios.
- **Temporal Changes:** The data collection was conducted twice with a three-month interval to test the model's robustness to temporal changes.
